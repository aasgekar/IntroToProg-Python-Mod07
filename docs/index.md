# Introduction
In this week’s assignment, the challenge was to create a Python script that incorporated the concepts of pickling and exceptions. In this document I’ll review how I utilized both pickling and exceptions, as well as discuss the purposes of those concepts and the benefits they can provide. The script I wrote functions as a list of dogs available for adoption in a shelter where the user can view, add and remove from the list.
