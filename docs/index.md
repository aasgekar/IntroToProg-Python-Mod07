# Introduction
In this week’s assignment, the challenge was to create a Python script that incorporated the concepts of pickling and exceptions. In this document I’ll review how I utilized both pickling and exceptions, as well as discuss the purposes of those concepts and the benefits they can provide. The script I wrote functions as a list of dogs available for adoption in a shelter where the user can view, add and remove from the list.

```python
strFileName = "AvailableDogs.dat"
listOfDogs = None
menu = "\nMenu of Available Actions:\n" \
       "1 - View dogs available for adoption\n" \
       "2 - Add a new dog into the system\n" \
       "3 - Remove a dog from the system\n" \
       "4 - Save your changes and exit the program\n"
```
